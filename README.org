* The Esoteric Programming Languages Zoo
The Esoteric Programming Languages Zoo (a.k.a esoo for short), is a repository
of implementations of esoteric programming languages. It is heavly inpired by
Andrej Bauer's plzoo. All of them have an esolang wiki page so if you want
informations about them go there. Some of them (like Cthulhu) was marked as
unimplemented before the esoo.
